# King County First Time Housing 

The purpose of this notebook will be to explore the features that have the highest contribution to the market value of market value of properties in King County Washington. Our target customers will be first time home buyers. Upon analyzing the King County House sales data, we will help local real estate agencies answer the questions from their clients, i.e. homeowners. In this kernel, I use various regression methods and try to predict house prices.

Based on our Regression models, with an R-squared value of 0.656, we can accurately suggest that first time home buyers buy property within the top ten zipcodes provided in this notebook, as well as stick to one to two bedrooms.
